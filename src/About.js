             Creative fields are my comfort zone. 
             I grew up composing music (I was a classically trained pianist from ages 6 to 18), 
             making films, and later creatively collaborating with others throughout college 
             (where I studied Video and Film Production) and after.
             My interpersonal skills have been refined over my years working in these endeavors as well as through years
             of providing customer service as a driver. My analytical skills have been developed through years of 
             classical music training, editing film projects, studying as a math major for 1 to 2 years in college, 
             and building software applications. Iâ€™m a very tireless worker as well, having spent years working long shifts
              in a fast paced distribution warehouse.</p>

                 Over the last year I've been in the process of transitioning into the tech industry. I spent 9 months in a 
                 tech program called Thinkful where I was trained extensively in full stack web development techniques and had private mentor sessions multiple 
                 times a week with a 15+ year software developer. 
                 {/* I had some experience prior to the program using some front-end languages and using Python. The tech
                 program is where I acquired the majority of my experience using frameworks such as React, Bootstrap, and Express,
